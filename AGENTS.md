# Agent Instructions

> **MOST IMPORTANT: This project uses Beads for issue tracking. Always use `bd` commands.**

## Priority #1: Use Beads

This project uses **bd** (beads) for AI-native issue tracking. This is the PRIMARY tool for managing work.

**Before starting ANY work:**

```bash
bd onboard            # Get started with beads (first time)
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
```

**While working:**

```bash
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd create "description"              # Create new issues
bd list                              # View all issues
```

**When finishing:**

```bash
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Session Completion (Landing the Plane)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Use `bd create` for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - `bd close` finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
